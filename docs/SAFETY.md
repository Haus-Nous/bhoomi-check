# BhoomiCheck Safety, Privacy, and Prototype Boundaries

## Hard boundaries

This repository is an independent hackathon prototype using synthetic/mock data only. It must not:

- access, scrape, crawl, reverse-engineer, or automate government websites or undocumented APIs;
- submit, track, or prepare an actual government application, claim, objection, payment, or OTP flow;
- request, receive, retain, or process real Aadhaar, PAN, bank/payment, or private land-record data;
- determine legal ownership, inheritance rights, title validity, or legal outcomes; or
- claim Government of Bihar affiliation, endorsement, operation, or branding.

## Implemented safeguards

- `PROTOTYPE_MODE = "synthetic-demo"` is a centralized server-side boundary. Case creation rejects non-`DEMO-...` identifiers and unlabelled/prohibited sensitive-looking case text; it is not an identity system.
- The UI identifies the product as an independent prototype using synthetic demo data and not legal advice.
- Seeded records and attachable fixtures are synthetic and labelled with demo identifiers.
- The current document path attaches only bundled fixtures; there is no arbitrary file-upload endpoint.
- `MockGovernmentAdapter` has no network behaviour and labels its output synthetic/non-official.
- Verification uses terms such as `POTENTIAL_ISSUE` and `INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE`; it does not pronounce a record invalid or name an owner.
- Every verification result keeps its source document references and evidence text.
- The review packet is a local MOCK preparation record. Marking it ready for review freezes local editing; it does not send, export, print, or submit anything.
- Demo reset is limited to the two built-in seed IDs and is not a generic delete operation; it cannot target an arbitrary created case.
- Parcel geometry is restricted to server-seeded fictional GeoJSON. It is labelled synthetic, is not an official cadastral boundary, and is never used to infer ownership, possession, encroachment, or a legal result.

## Extraction and AI guardrails

Gemini or OpenAI extraction is optional, server-side, and only applicable to synthetic fixture text. The selected provider may suggest structured candidate fields, but accepted fields require schema validation, evidence-span validation, and semantic grounding against labelled source text. The deterministic verification service—not an LLM—decides whether a comparable discrepancy exists.

The application does not send arbitrary user uploads to a model provider because arbitrary uploads are not supported. Provider errors return safe citizen-facing failures without credentials, stack traces, database paths, raw SQL, or provider internals.

## Current local-data limitation

Case state is stored in local SQLite for the prototype. The application has no authentication, session boundary, tenant isolation, production retention/deletion workflow, encryption-at-rest deployment configuration, or production incident-response controls. Case-scoped resource validation prevents a nested document or packet ID from being used under a different selected case; it is not privacy, access control, or tenant isolation. Do not use it with real information.

## Future work, explicitly not implemented

Future production work would need authenticated access, tenant isolation, managed encrypted storage, retention controls, redacted telemetry, controlled uploads, malware/content checks, human review, and approved documented government interfaces. Those controls cannot be inferred from the current local prototype.

## Misuse review

| Risk | Current mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Output is treated as official or legal | Persistent prototype language, non-legal wording, source traceability, and no submission path |
| Real records are added | Bundled synthetic fixtures only; no arbitrary upload control |
| Extraction invents a fact | Candidate validation, source spans, semantic grounding, and accepted-fact persistence boundary |
| A missing fact becomes a false discrepancy | Deterministic `INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE` outcome |
| Government affiliation confusion | Independent brand, no government logos, no live integration |
| Synthetic map is mistaken for a cadastral record | Persistent synthetic-boundary wording, no real geometry source, and no map-derived legal/discrepancy result |
| Cross-user privacy expectation | Explicit local-prototype limitation; P1-09 authentication/session/tenancy is deferred |

## Release checklist

- [ ] All visible fixtures, people, identifiers, maps, and parcels are synthetic.
- [ ] No live government URLs, API clients, scraping code, or official logos are added.
- [ ] No secrets or `.env` files are committed.
- [ ] No screen describes a potential issue as a legal conclusion.
- [ ] New documentation distinguishes implemented prototype behaviour from future production work.
- [ ] Any future upload or export feature is reviewed against these boundaries before implementation.
# Synthetic parcel comparison safety

Parcel Intelligence uses only synthetic documents and synthetic GeoJSON. Its area tolerances are illustrative demo policy, not government, legal, statutory, cadastral, or measurement standards. A mapped boundary is contextual and does not prove ownership, possession, encroachment, or record correctness.
